        <h2>A fantastic low-maintenance alternative to the delicious, but finicky, smoked brisket.</h2>

    <p>
    The smoked chuck roast is a great "set it and forget it" recipe. It retains smoke very well, doesn't stall like a brisket tends to do, and is delicious. It's very simple and is a blank canvas for you to season and flavor as desired.

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Chuck roast, 3-4 pounds</li>
        <li>Kosher Salt</li>
        <li>Ground Black Pepper</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>Directions:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the roast liberally with salt and pepper on all sides. Other seasonings can be added if desired.</li>
            <li>Allow roast to rest in the fridge for at least 2 hour, ideally overnight. Pull roast out of the fridge 45-60 minutes prior to cooking to allow it to reach room temperature.</li>
            <li>Preheat smoker to 225° F, using your preferred type of wood. Insert a thermometer probe in the thickest part of the roast.</li>
            <li>Cook roast in smoker until internal temperature reaches about 205° F. This can take as little as 4-5 hours, or upwards of 8-9 hours. Cooking time depends on a number of factors, so be sure to watch the thermometer.
                <ul>
                    <li>If desired, pull roast out when the internal temperature reaches about 160° F and wrap with preferred wrapping material, like oven-safe butcher paper or aluminum foil. This will help retain some moisture, but will soften the bark.</li>
                    <li>You can also baste roast with your favorite barbeque sauce or glaze.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Once the roast has reached temperature, remove from smoker and wrap. Allow to rest in a small cooler for approximately an hour.</li>
            <li>When ready to serve, cut slices against the grain.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
        <h3>Notes:</h3>
            <li>As mentioned above, cook times can vary based on a number of factors. Watch the thermometer as the temperature is more important than the cook time.</li>
            <br>
            <li>This cut of meat benefits from the "low and slow" style of cooking. This allows the connective tissure to break down and make the meat tender, soft, and juicy.</li>
            <br>
            <li>Be sure to cut against the grain. This will help with the tenderness of the pieces. I personally like to chop up the slices into smaller bite-size chunks.</li>
